## Base Map

```{r load-data}
ma_towns <- st_read("data/townssurvey_shp/TOWNSSURVEY_POLYM.shp")
```

```{r join-shape}
map_data <- seamstresses %>% 
  filter(state == "MA") %>% 
  filter(is.na(city) == FALSE) %>% 
  select(city) %>% 
  mutate(city = case_when(city == "Williamsburgh" ~ "WILLIAMSBURG",
                          TRUE ~ toupper(city))) %>% 
  group_by(city) %>% 
  summarize(number = n()) %>% 
  right_join(y = ma_towns, by = c("city" = "TOWN")) %>% 
  select(city, number, geometry) 
```

```{r ggplot-map}
ggplot(data = map_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry, fill = number)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightskyblue", high = "midnightblue", na.value = "white") +
  labs(title = "Ads per Town",
       subtitle = "Massachusetts",
       color = "Number of Ads") +
  theme_void()
  
```
## Regionality of Job Titles

```{r job-titles-frequency}

  mutate(job_title = fct_collapse(job_title,
    Milliner = c("Milliner", "milliner"),

  mutate(city = case_when(city == "Williamsburgh" ~ "WILLIAMSBURG",
                          TRUE ~ toupper(city))) %>% 
  right_join(y = ma_towns, by = c("city" = "TOWN")) %>% 
  select(city, job_title, geometry) 
```

  labs(title = "Most Popular Job Title",
         subtitle = "By Town",
         color = "Job Title") +
  theme_void()
```

```{r worcester-original}

  filter(is.na(address) == FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(street_address = paste(address, city, state, sep = ", ")) %>% 
  select(name, job_title, street_address, year, source_name) 
```

```{r worcester-geo}
worcester <- worcester %>% 
  mutate_geocode(location = street_address, 
         output = "latlon", 
         source = "google")
