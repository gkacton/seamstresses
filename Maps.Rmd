## Libraries

```{r load-packages}

library(tidyverse) ## For plotting and data wrangling.

library(leaflet) ## For leaflet interactive maps

library(sf) ## For spatial data

library(RColorBrewer) ## For colour palettes

library(htmltools) ## For html

library(leafsync) ## For placing plots side by side

library(kableExtra) ## Table output

source("data_cleaning.R")
```

## Base Map

```{r load-data}
ma_towns <- st_read("data/townssurvey_shp/TOWNSSURVEY_POLYM.shp")
```

```{r join-shape}
map_data <- seamstresses %>% 
  filter(state == "MA") %>% 
  filter(is.na(city) == FALSE) %>% 
  select(city) %>% 
  mutate(city = case_when(city == "Williamsburgh" ~ "WILLIAMSBURG",
                          TRUE ~ toupper(city))) %>% 
  group_by(city) %>% 
  summarize(number = n()) %>% 
  right_join(y = ma_towns, by = c("city" = "TOWN")) %>% 
  select(city, number, geometry) 
```

```{r ggplot-map}
ggplot(map_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry, fill = number)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightskyblue", high = "midnightblue", na.value = "white")
```
## Regionality of Job Titles

```{r job-titles-frequency}
job_title_popularity <- seamstresses %>% 
  separate_rows(job_title, sep = "; ") %>% 
  mutate(job_title = fct_collapse(job_title,
    Milliner = c("Milliner", "milliner"),
    Dressmaker = c("Dressmaker", "dressmaker"),
    Tailor = c("Tailor"),
    Tailoress = c("Tailoress", "tailoress"),
    Mantuamaker = c("Mantuamaker", "mantuamaker", "Mantua-Maker"),
    Apprentices = c("apprentices")
  )) %>% 
  filter(state == "MA", is.na(job_title) == FALSE, is.na(city) == FALSE) %>% 
  group_by(city) %>% 
  count(job_title) %>% 
  slice(which.max(n)) %>% 
  mutate(city = case_when(city == "Williamsburgh" ~ "WILLIAMSBURG",
                          TRUE ~ toupper(city))) %>% 
  right_join(y = ma_towns, by = c("city" = "TOWN")) %>% 
  select(city, job_title, geometry) 
```

```{r job-title-map}
ggplot(job_title_popularity) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry, fill = job_title)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Apprentices" = "#DDCC77", "Dressmaker" = "#CC6677", "Mantuamaker" = "#AA4499", "Milliner" = "#882255", "Tailor" = "#88CCEE", "Tailoress" = "#44AA99", "NA" = "white"))
